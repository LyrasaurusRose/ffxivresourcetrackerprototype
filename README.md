# FFXIV Resource Tracker Prototype
A prototype of a FFXIV resource tracker written in C# with .NET

# Overview
This week I decided that I wanted to mess around with C# since I haven't touched it much before. I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy: XIV, and one of the aspects of the game is that you can gather plants for different professions. These plants spawn into the world at set tiems everyday, and sometimes it's hard to keep track of all of them.

Because of this, I figured that a pretty straight forward program would be to create a small tracker of some of the most important items that I gather, and make a program to tell me what time they spawn so that I don't have to keep looking them up.

I ran a bit short on time with my prototype, with my schooling and such, but future work will hopefully bring my project to completion with adding a timer function that will ring when it gets close to the spawning time of the item.

# Future Work
* I want to add a progress bar that shows how long in the real world it is until the requested item spawns
* I want to add support for more items
* Clean up the interface and make it look neater :)
